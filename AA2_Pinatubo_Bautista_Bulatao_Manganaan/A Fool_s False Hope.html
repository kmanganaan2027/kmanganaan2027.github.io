					My cards lay before you, yet yours stay out of sight
					<br>
					My wishful thoughts mention not of your wrongs but these voices of reason shout,
					<br>
					“Oh, foolish one, stop looking for confessions day and night
					<br>
					You will fall the hard way down instead of walking out” 
					<br><br>
					On what we are, I am unsure
					<br>
					It’s precarious but I will not falter
					<br>
					I dream of you standing by my side as I lay beside yours
					<br>
					And maybe one day, you’ll kiss me at the altar
					<br><br>
					On how I’d been so blind, I have only myself to blame
					<br>
					As goodbye screams in your silence, I learn my lesson
					<br>
					Men love the wild ones yet marry the tame
					<br>
					And the voices say this while you bluff of your “good” intentions
					<br><br>
					“Oh, foolish one, soon your real knight shall confess
					<br>
					He just wasn't the one, that I can express”

					My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
					<br>
					Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
					<br>
					And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
					<br>
					You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
					<br>
					Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
					<br>
					And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
					<br><br>
					And the voices say, "You are not the exception
					<br>
					You will never learn your lesson"
					<br><br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
					<br>
					That ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
					<br><br>
					You know how to keep me waitin'
					<br>
					I know how to act like I'm fine
					<br>
					Don't know what to call this situation
					<br>
					But I know I can't call you mine
					<br>
					And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
					<br>
					'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
					<br>
					It starts thinkin' you'll come around
					<br>
					And maybe, someday, when we're older
					<br>
					This is something we'll laugh about
					<br>
					Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news
					<br><br>
					But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
					<br>
					You will never learn your lesson"
					<br><br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
					<br>
					That ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
					<br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
					<br>
					That ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
					<br><br>
					Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
					<br>
					Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
					<br>
					Oh, you haven't written me or called
					<br>
					But goodbye screamin' in the silence
					<br>
					And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
					<br><br>
					'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
					<br>
					I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
					<br>
					And you will say you had the best of intentions
					<br>
					And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
					<br><br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
					<br>
					That ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
					<br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
					<br>
					That ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh
					<br><br>
					La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
					<br>
					La-la-la-la-la
					<br>
					Ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
					<br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
					<br>
					They ain't never gonna come
					<br>
					And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
					<br>
					Foolish one
					<br>
					The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
					<br>
					When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
					<br>
					No, he just wasn't the one
