					Ensure you stay unseen, this thing is forbidden<br>
					Hood on your head, your eyes kissing the ground<br>
					And think that you can always stop this cursed merry-go-round<br>
					What started in rooms winsome and wooden<br>
					Now in parking lots are hidden<br>
					Leave the perfume on the shelf, so that you cannot be found<br>
					See the words as what they are, a drug that only astounds<br>
					The first few times, a gorgeous crime, before leaving you guilt-ridden<br><br>

					Yet that's the thing about clandestine affairs<br>
					Filled with those longing stares and that hidden glance<br>
					It's birthed from a single gaze before dissolving in air<br>
					It shows its truth for but a moment, and it's so full of care<br>
					But it lies and it lies, oh it's such a horrid trance<br>
					Oh I wish I never dared<br>

				<p class="title2">by Taylor Swift</p>

				<p class="text">
					Make sure nobody sees you leave<br>
					Hood over your head, keep your eyes down<br>
					Tell your friends you're out for a run<br>
					You'll be flushed when you return<br>
					Take the road less traveled by<br>
					Tell yourself you can always stop<br>
					What started in beautiful rooms<br>
					Ends with meetings in parking lots<br>
					And that's the thing about illicit affairs<br>
					And clandestine meetings and longing stares<br>
					It's born from just one single glance<br>
					But it dies, and it dies, and it dies<br>
					A million little times<br>
					Leave the perfume on the shelf<br>
					That you picked out just for him<br>
					So you leave no trace behind<br>
					Like you don't even exist<br>
					Take the words for what they are<br>
					A dwindling, mercurial high<br>
					A drug that only worked<br>
					The first few hundred times<br><br>
					And that's the thing about illicit affairs<br>
					And clandestine meetings and stolen stares<br>
					They show their truth one single time<br>
					But they lie, and they lie, and they lie<br>
					A million little times<br><br>
					And you wanna scream<br>
					Don't call me "kid"<br>
					Don't call me "baby"<br>
					Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me<br>
					You showed me colors<br>
					You know I can't see with anyone else<br><br>
					Don't call me "kid"<br>
					Don't call me "baby"<br>
					Look at this idiotic fool that you made me<br>
					You taught me a secret language<br>
					I can't speak with anyone else<br><br>
					And you know damn well<br><br>
					For you, I would ruin myself<br>
					A million little times<br>
