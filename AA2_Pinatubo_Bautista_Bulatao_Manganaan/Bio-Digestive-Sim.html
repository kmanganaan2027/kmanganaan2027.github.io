	   <br><br> Our laboratory page aims to demonstrate the various parts and functions of the digestive system. The digestive system plays an important role in keeping the body healthy.  This system is responsible in digesting and absorbing nutrients from the food so that the body can work properly.   The simulation activity provides a clearer understanding on how the digestive system works by presenting the mechanical and chemical digestions, and absorption of food.

		In order to carry out this experiment, we placed some bananas and crackers in a zip-lock bag and crushed them.  We observed that the bag acted like the mouth and the crushing of food is similar to the mechanical digestion of the teeth where food is broken down into smaller particles.  Then water was added to the mixture.  The water serves as a lubricant for the food, much like how saliva lubricates the food in our mouth.  After that, orange juice was added to the mixture.  In this stage, we observed that the bag resembles the stomach where food is chemically broken down.  We noticed that the chemically digestive properties of stomach acid are emulated by the orange juice, as both are acidic substances that have similar pH values.  Since the bananas and crackers are broken down by acidic orange juice, the biomolecules digested in the simulation are likely carbohydrates (as the crackers are from processed grains and bananas are fruit) and lipids (from the oil in the cracker dough).<br><br>

		Afterwards, we transferred the mixture into a leg of a sock, straining it in the process. The resulting liquid was then collected in a tray and represents the nutrients extracted by the small intestine (represented by the sock). The tray stands for the rest of the human body, which makes use of the nutrients extracted. <br><br>
		The partially solid substance left inside the stocking resembles the "chyme" found inside our bodies, while the pushing action acts like the involuntary contractions of the stomach and the small intestine called peristalsis. <br><br>

		In this experiment, we prepared the set-up by filling four graduated cylinders with equal amounts of water, and folded four paper towels of the same size, increasing the amount of folds each time. Afterwards, we fully dipped a paper towel in each cylinder and measured the difference in the water level after taking the towels out. <br><br>
		We observed that the paper towel with the most folds (4) absorbed the most amount of liquid. This may be due to the fact that folding an object increases its surface area, therefore allowing more of it to be in contact with liquid and absorb more water. This is similar to how villi in the small intestine work, and helps it easily absorb the nutrients in the food. The small intestine itself is also extremely folded inside the body to maximize the space available and, again, allows it to absorb nutrients easily. As the villi are also extremely thin, it is able to absorb the nutrients quickly through a process called diffusion.

		To simulate the action of bile on the digested food, we then placed a teaspoon of vegetable oil and water inside two identical jars, labeled jar A and jar B.  After placing the vegetable oil and water, we placed a few drops of liquid dish soap inside jar A. Bile aids in chemical digestion by helping the body break down fats into fatty acids through the emulsification of fats. The end products of this process can be easily absorbed by the body.<br><br>

	<div class="text">
		Understanding how the digestive system works is significant because it is the primary source of nutrient ingestion in the body.  This simulation helps recognize the various functions of the digestive organs and enzymes that keep you healthy and energized.<br>

	After the food is being ingested and mechanically digested in the mouth, it is transferred to the stomach via the esophagus.  The stomach is where the food is chemically digested by the gastric acid and by the contractions and churning of gastric muscles.  The digested food then passes through the small intestine.  As the food goes through the small intestine, the liver secretes an enzyme known as bile that breaks down fats.  Thin villi that line the intestine allow the nutrients to diffuse from the food to the bloodstream and then to the rest of the body.  The walls of the small intestine are also folded, thus, increasing the surface area in order to absorb more nutrients.  When the food reaches the large intestine, most of the nutrients have already been absorbed, leaving behind a partially solid material known as feces.  Feces passes through the large intestine, then later goes through the rectum and exits the body through the anus.
