					T'was a happy hour of horrid deeds<br>
					We lit a flame, we started a game<br>
					An excuse I needed in order to be freed<br>
					To leave my old flame was my aim<br><br>

					A cross marks the spot where we crucified our hearts<br>
					He poisoned the pond, I was pondering our love<br>
					Shouldn&#39;t we have known we were doomed from the start?<br>
					Men like us were made to be mourning doves<br><br>

					Quick as we were to our getaway car<br>
					Quicker was the regret that shook me to the core<br>
					Dearest, fools like us never run far<br>
					And traitors like us shall always be abhorred<br><br>


					We were thriving in this torrid affair<br>
					It was fated that we were a doomed pair

					No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br><br>
					It was the best of times, the worst of crimes<br>
					I struck a match and blew your mind<br>
					But I didn't mean it<br>
					And you didn't see it<br>
					The ties were black, the lies were white<br>
					In shades of gray in candlelight<br>
					I wanted to leave him<br>
					I needed a reason<br><br>

					"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart<br>
					He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself<br>
					I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
					We never had a shotgun shot in the dark<br><br>

					You were driving the getaway car<br>
					We were flying, but we'd never get far<br>
					Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
					Think about the place where you first met me<br>
					We're riding in a getaway car<br>
					There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
					Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
					Think about the place where you first met me<br>
					In a getaway car<br>
					No, they never get far<br>
					No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br><br>

					It was the great escape, the prison break<br>
					The light of freedom on my face<br>
					But you weren't thinking<br>
					And I was just drinking<br>
					Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go!'<br>
					But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow<br>
					And a circus ain't a love story<br>
					And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)<br><br>

					"X" marks the spot, where we fell apart<br>
					He poisoned the well, every man for himself<br>
					I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed<br>
					It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart<br><br>

					You were driving the getaway car<br>
					We were flying, but we'd never get far<br>
					Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
					Think about the place where you first met me<br>
					We're riding in a getaway car<br>
					There were sirens in the beat of your heart<br>
					Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
					Think about the place where you first met me<br>
					In a getaway car<br>
					No, they never get far<br>
					No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br><br>

					We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde<br>
					Until I switched to the other side<br>
					To the other side<br>
					It's no surprise, I turned you in<br>
					'Cause us traitors never win<br><br>

					I'm in a getaway car<br>
					I left you in a motel bar<br>
					Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys<br>
					That was the last time you ever saw me<br><br>

					Driving the getaway car<br>
					We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)<br>
					Don't pretend it's such a mystery<br>
					Think about the place where you first met me<br>
					We're riding in a getaway car<br>
					There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)<br>
					Should've known I'd be the first to leave<br>
					Think about the place where you first met me<br>
					In a getaway car<br>
					No, they never get far<br>
					No, nothing good starts in a getaway car<br><br>

					I was riding in a getaway car<br>
					I was crying in a getaway car<br>
					I was dying in a getaway car<br>
					Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car<br><br>

					I was riding in a getaway car<br>
					I was crying in a getaway car<br>
					I was dying in a getaway car<br>
					Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car<br>
