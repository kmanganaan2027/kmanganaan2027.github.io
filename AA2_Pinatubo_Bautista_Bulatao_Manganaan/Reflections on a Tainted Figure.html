					Lost and hurt, I don&#8217;t know what to say<br>
					Looking at your face seems wrong<br>
					In my loving arms, you do not belong<br>
					Ever since you chose to betray<br>
					In disgraceful dilemmas you should’ve chosen to stay<br>
					But you and I shall never get along<br>
					You’re sorry for not being loyal and strong<br>
					Yet forgiveness was denied for my trust went away<br><br>

					“Did you think of me?  Had everything been worth it?”<br>
					Sorrowful interrogations once I found out<br>
					Insincerity in voice, inability to admit<br>
					I didn’t know what you are all about<br>
					An untrustworthy shadow, how could I commit<br>
					To a relationship shrouded in lies and doubt<br>

					It's strange to think the songs we used to sing<br>
					The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone<br>
					Yesterday I found out about you<br>
					Even now just looking at you<br>
					Feels wrong<br>
					You say that you'd take it all back<br>
					Given one chance, it was a moment of weakness<br>
					And you said, "Yes"<br><br>

					You should've said, "No"<br>
					You should've gone home<br>
					You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
					You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her<br>
					Get back to me<br>
					And I should've been there<br>
					In the back of your mind<br>
					I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
					You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet<br>
					You should've said, "No"<br>
					Baby, and you might still have me<br><br>

					You can see that I've been cryin'<br>
					Baby, you know all the right things<br>
					To say<br>
					But do you honestly expect me to believe<br>
					We could ever be the same?<br>
					You say that the past is the past<br>
					You need one chance, it was a moment of weakness<br>
					And you said, "Yes"<br><br>

					You should've said, "No"<br>
					You should've gone home<br>
					You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
					You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her<br>
					Get back to me (get back to me)<br>
					And I should've been there<br>
					In the back of your mind<br>
					I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
					You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet<br>
					You should've said, "No"<br>
					Baby, and you might still have me, oh-whoa<br><br>

					I can't resist<br>
					Before you go, tell me this<br>
					Was it worth it?<br>
					Was she worth this?<br>
					No, no, no, no, no, no<br><br>

					You should've said, "No"<br>
					You should've gone home<br>
					You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go<br>
					You should've known that word 'bout what you did with her<br>
					Get back to me (get back to me)<br>
					And I should've been there<br>
					In the back of your mind<br>
					I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"<br>
					You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet<br>
					You should've said, "No"<br>
					Baby, and you might still have me<br>
