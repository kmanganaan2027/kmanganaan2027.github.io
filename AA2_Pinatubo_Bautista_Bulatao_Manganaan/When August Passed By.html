					I&#8217;ve never needed anything more sublime
					<br>
					Than our town&#8217;s salty air and your doors rust
					<br>
					Unsure as we were, in you, I instilled my trust
					<br>
					The things I&#8217;ve never done, with you, I might try
					<br>
					August slipped past me as it faded into time
					<br>
					Lost in my memories, I can still see “us”
					<br>
					Those private moments I cherish because
					<br>
					August passed by for it was never mine
					<br><br>
					Remember how your getaway car was the one I was driving?
					<br>
					And how in waiting to make plans with you, I canceled my own?
					<br>
					Back when I had lived solely to yearn
					I was content with simply wanting
					<br>
					Summer love and saying “us” you’ve outgrown
					<br>
					Because you were never mine to lose, that I can discern

					Salt air, and the rust on your door
					<br>
					I never needed anything more
					<br>
					Whispers of "Are you sure?"
					<br>
					"Never have I ever before"
					<br><br>
					But I can see us lost in the memory
					<br>
					August slipped away into a moment in time
					<br>
					'Cause it was never mine
					<br>
					And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
					<br>
					August sipped away like a bottle of wine
					<br>
					'Cause you were never mine
					<br><br>
					Your back beneath the sun
					<br>
					Wishin' I could write my name on it
					<br>
					Will you call when you're back at school?
					<br>
					I remember thinkin' I had you
					<br><br>
					But I can see us lost in the memory
					<br>
					August slipped away into a moment in time
					<br>
					'Cause it was never mine
					<br>
					And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
					<br>
					August sipped away like a bottle of wine
					'Cause you were never mine
					<br>
					<br><br>
					Back when we were still changin' for the better
					<br>
					Wanting was enough
					<br>
					For me, it was enough
					<br>
					To live for the hope of it all
					<br>
					Cancel plans just in case you'd call
					<br>
					And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
					<br>
					So much for summer love and saying "us"
					<br>
					'Cause you weren't mine to lose
					<br>
					You weren't mine to lose, no
					<br><br>
					But I can see us lost in the memory
					<br>
					August slipped away into a moment in time
					<br>
					'Cause it was never mine
					<br>
					And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
					<br>
					August sipped away like a bottle of wine
					<br>
					'Cause you were never mine
					<br>
					'Cause you were never mine, never mine
					<br><br>
					But do you remember?
					<br>
					Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
					<br>
					And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
					<br>
					Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
					<br>
					"Meet me behind the mall"
					<br><br>
					Remember when I pulled up and said, "Get in the car"
					<br>
					And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
					<br>
					Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (for the hope of it all)
					<br><br>
					For the hope of it all
					<br>
					For the hope of it all
					<br>
					(For the hope of it all)
					<br>
					(For the hope of it all)
